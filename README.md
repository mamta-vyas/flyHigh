# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Context
In the context of your code, data is the response from the API that contains a list of hotels. The goal here is to add only new hotels to the existing list of hotels in the state, avoiding duplicates.

The Line in Question
javascript
Copy code
const newHotels = data.filter(hotel => !hotels.some(existingHotel => existingHotel.id === hotel.id));
Breakdown
data.filter(...):

The filter method creates a new array containing only the elements that pass a specified test. In this case, it will filter through the hotels received from the API.
hotel => ...:

This is an arrow function that represents the condition used to test each hotel in the data array.
!hotels.some(...):

The some method tests whether at least one element in the hotels array passes the provided test.
It returns true if it finds an existing hotel with the same ID; otherwise, it returns false.
existingHotel => existingHotel.id === hotel.id:

This inner arrow function checks if any existingHotel in the hotels array has the same ID as the current hotel being processed in the filter method.
Combining It All:

The ! operator negates the result of some. So, the condition !hotels.some(...) will be true if no existing hotel has the same ID as the current hotel.
Thus, newHotels will be an array of hotels that are not already in the hotels state.
Updating State with New Hotels
javascript
Copy code
setHotels(prevHotels => [...prevHotels, ...newHotels]);
Breakdown
setHotels(...):

This function updates the state of hotels.
prevHotels => ...:

This is an updater function that takes the previous state (prevHotels) as an argument.
[...prevHotels, ...newHotels]:

The spread operator (...) is used here to create a new array that combines:
All the previous hotels in the state (prevHotels).
All the newly fetched hotels that are not duplicates (newHotels).
This results in a single array that contains both the previously stored hotels and the new ones, effectively updating the state without mutating the previous state.
Checking for More Hotels
javascript
Copy code
setHasMore(newHotels.length > 0);
Breakdown
newHotels.length > 0:

This checks if there are any new hotels fetched. If the length of newHotels is greater than 0, it means there are indeed more hotels available.
setHasMore(...):

This updates the hasMore state. If there are new hotels (newHotels.length > 0), hasMore will be set to true; otherwise, it will be false.
Summary
Purpose: This code block ensures that only new hotels (not already in the state) are added to the hotels array, preventing duplicates. It also updates the loading state to reflect whether there are more hotels available to fetch.
Functionality: The combination of filter and some allows for efficient checking of duplicates, while the use of the spread operator helps in immutably updating the state.
